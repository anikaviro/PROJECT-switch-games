Uncover the truth and delve into a 2D sidescrolling adventure featuring gorgeous art and environments. Then, battle the kaiju in fast-paced, top-down combat. Customize the Sentinels with an arsenal of mechsuit weaponry, and fight to defend humanity! A departure from the studio's traditional fantasy style, the game takes place in a modern setting punctuated with giant mechs. Although the world may be bleak, Vanillaware's signature artistic shine and gorgeous aesthetics will bring the characters and story of 13 Sentinels to life. CHARACTERS: JURO KURABEA mild-mannered young high school student trying to live a normal life in the 80s. Rarely excited, he is fond of campy old Sci-Fi movies, with their giant robots and space invasions. But it seems like everyone in his life is trying to manipulate him for their own ominous ends... IORI FUYUSAKAShe believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call? EI SEKIGAHARA A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past. Declared a boy ""from another dimension"", he's constantly pursued by armed gunmen in black suits, and often finds himself in intense life-or-death situations. Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... KEITARO MIURA A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a ""Sentinel"", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II... MEGUMI YAKUSHIJIA shy, composed girl of few words, with a nurturing domestic side. While she's devoted to her beloved, Juro, he himself has lost all memory of their past relationship. Goaded on by a mysterious talking cat, she agrees to a ""contract"" -- willing to go to any length to restore the boy she loves. NATSUNO MINAMI A perky, friendly girl on her high school's track team who loves a good Sci-Fi story. When she discovers a small robot hiding in the school, it seems like a story out of one of her favorite movies. However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real. NENJI OGATAA high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head. Still, he's determined to bust through and save the girl -- even if he's resigned to her thinking he's just another thug. RENYA GOUTOA cold, brilliant young man who will use any means necessary to find the truth. Gouto processes information and startling revelations with a calm, ready intelligence that baffles (or outpaces) the adults around him. He's no villain, but he knows what's at stake, and what must be done. RYOKO SHININOME An aloof agent desperate to prove her worth to her unrequited love (and mentor) Tetsuya Ida. A mission gone wrong left Ryoko with traumatic brain damage, and dependent on a medicine of unclear origins. Still, she fights through the mental fog and pain to untangle the conspiracies... SHU AMIGUCHI An easygoing late-80s high school playboy, quick to make friends and quick to flirt. Tries not to take life too seriously, whether it's on his side or not. But when his TV turns on by itself, and an idol starts talking to him through it, begging for his help unraveling a mystery...he rolls with it as best he can. TAKATOSHI HIJIYAMAA confident young Japanese soldier in the 1940s, displaced from his home and dropped into a city both foreign and familiar. Adrift, old-fashioned, and out of place, he struggles to make sense of all the changes in his world...and then, after months of living as a solitary vagrant, he finds the young man responsible for uprooting his life. TOMI KISARAGIA flippant, shy teenager. She often hangs out with her gal pals after school, getting snacks and chatting like any other, but she seems to know more than she lets on. Determined to investigate the mysteries of her fate, she surreptitiously follows whatever lead she can, only to discover even greater peril awaiting her... YUKI TAKAMIYA A surly delinquent who (reluctantly) infiltrates the school as a spy to save her best friend. Despite her disdain for her underhanded allies, she stubbornly seeks the truth when everyone else has something to hide. Tough and caustic, but she's got a protective streak and a sharp mind.… Expand, Vanillaware, Adventure, General, No Online Multiplayer, On GameFAQs, T, 31

Long a center of naval commerce, the people of the isles struggled throughout history for dominion over her shores. Finally there rose a man to put an end to this conflict: Dorgalua Oberyth. But history would know him as the ""Dynast-King."" King Dorgalua strove to stamp out the hatred among the people of the isles, and for fully half a century, Valeria knew prosperity. Yet upon the king's death, civil war erupted anew as three factions vied for control: the Bakram, who comprised much of Valeria's nobility; the Galgastani, whose people made up the majority of the isles' population; and the Walister, who numbered but few. The isles were soon divided between the Bakram and Galgastani, and an uneasy peace settled across the land.

Bullet hell style mechanics is having a kind ofInspired by classic Japanese shooting games, Danmaku Unlimited 3 is a lovingly crafted medley of the best aspects of Japanese bullet hell games, all in a polished, accessible package. An old school shoot'em up? Why is it worth my time?Bullet hell style mechanics is having a kind of renaissance with its inclusion in many hit indie games. However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer. Danmaku Unlimited 3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that makes the genre so exciting to play. Okay, so how does the game do that?CORE A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft, the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire. GRAZING Get the core close to bullets to just barely ""graze"" it will power up the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss. SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane. All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot.I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't I just breeze though the game then?The game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles.Is there a story?It is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers. Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right?How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music!Music is by BLANKFIELD from Japan, who does awesome remixes of Touhou and many other anime/game musics!Anything else? - The campaign features 5 stages each ending with an epic multi-stage boss fight.- Up to 25 weapon combinations for players to unlock and experiment to find what works best for them.- Unique rendering technique that procedurally animate sprites on the fly.- TATE support for players that use vertical screens. Or if you like to play lying down on your sides, I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. Okay I'm sold! (Or not, if so then thanks for making it down to here!) TLDR List - Authentically crafted Japanese style shoot'em up in High Definition- Intuitively designed to be an accessible gateway to the world of Bullet Hell- 5 handcrafted stages packed with dynamically rendered sprites- Epic multi-phase boss battles with spellbinding bullet patterns- Up to 25 unique weapon combinations- Turn enemy attacks into your advantage with the SPIRIT/GRAZE system- Music by the talented Japanese indie circle BLANKFIELD  Multiple modes of difficulty that caters to players of all skill ranges… Expand, Doragon Entertainment, Action, Shooter, Shoot-'Em-Up, Vertical, No Online Multiplayer, On GameFAQs, E10+, 6
